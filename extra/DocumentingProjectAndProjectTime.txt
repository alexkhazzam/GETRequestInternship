Setting up project--installing webpack and eslint to provide a good development-experience involving saving code automatically with npm run build:dev and bundling production-ready code with npm run build:prod; also creating multiple JS files in the "src" folder to structure the code in order to have it well organized and not "all over the place." Don't know if I will keep the Packages folder; it is there so that if the user clicks on their searched item, it will redirect them to another page that renders that item's content.

    configuring a GET request. Didn't hook it up to the "search" button yet--just wanted to handle the HTTP request before anything else. It was tricky getting the nested elements but I managed to do it with a for loop--amongst some other things. Writing the structure of the HTTP request took time as well, and it was time consuming trying to figure out a way to target the nested elements in the "items" array. I used xml instead of the fetch() API because it is used in old and new browsers, whereas the fetch() API is only used in modern ones--some people will not be able to access it. I will be adding some error-handling features to this GET request in the later commits.
